# k defects are randomly distributed amongst n integrated-circuit chips produced
# by a factory (any number of defects may be found on a chip and each defect is
# independent of the other defects).
#
# Let p(k,n) represent the probability that there is a chip with at least 3
# defects. For instance p(3,7) â‰ˆ 0.0204081633.
#
# Find p(20 000, 1 000 000) and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places in
# the form 0.abcdefghij

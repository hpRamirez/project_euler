# There are some prime values, p, for which there exists a

# What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with

# four such primes below one-hundred.

# How many primes below one million have this remarkable

        As taken from the forum:
        Since x^3 = n^2(n + p), and p is a prime, it turns
        out that n must be a cube, as well as n + p, i.e.,
        we must have p = a^3 - b^3 for some a, b.

        But, for a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) to be
        prime we must have a - b = 1, so p must be a
        difference of consecutive cubes.
